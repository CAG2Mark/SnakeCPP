# SnakeCPP
Someone challenged me to write snake in C++.

This is licensed under the MIT license but honestly I don't really care if you steal this and do whatever you want with it

# Compiling
You will need MinGW installed and this only works on Windows.

To compile, simply run `g++ snake.cpp -o snake.exe`.
